# D2MAC baseband file viewer

VirtualDub plug-in to view D2MAC baseband file generated by hacktv. 

Scrambling used here was line cut and rotate, similar to Videocrypt. There were two modes: single cut, where only chroma part was cut and rotated along with luma and double cut, where chroma and luma were cut and rotated separately.

Supports free access scrambling.

Generate file using hacktv:

$ hacktv -o /dev/stdout -m d2mac -t uint8 -o baseband.bin --single-cut -s 20250000

When loading into VirtualDub, ensure that width and height are set to 1296 x 625.
